# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Chapters 1 and 2
We are using  Apache Tomcat as our web container. This most common and popular web container today(page 20 Java for Web Applications). 
We also started to learn about using servlet. They are what receives and responds to the end user. 
Servlets have a few methods that are essential to get data from the user. ```DOGET() and DOPOST()```
We also started to learn about the ``@WEBSERVLET()`` which is used to define a servlet component in a web application.


## Chapter 3 and 4
