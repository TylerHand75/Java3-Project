# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Chapters 1 and 2
we are using tomcat as our web container. this is the easiest web container that is on the market to use. 
we also started to learn about using servlet. They are what receives and responds to the end user. 
Servlets have a few methods that are essential to get data from the user. ```DOGET() and DOPOST()```
We also started to learn about the ``@WEBSERVLET()`` which is used to define a servlet component in a web application.
This will be a fun semester learning to make products that I can use on the web. 

## Chapter 3 and 4
